# Phases
Phases is a web application that displays what the moon looks like on any given day. It will also calculate the illuminated percentage of the moon, as well as the current phase, closest phase, moonrise, and moonset. 

This application uses the [Astronomical Applications department API](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/api.php#rstt) to generate the image of the moon, as well as the corresponding data.
